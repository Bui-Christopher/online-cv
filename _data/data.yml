career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a backend, software engineer with most of my professional experience within startups! Initially, school was difficult, and I briefly dropped out of college.
      Despite struggling, I persevered and proudly graduated with a degree in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. <br><br>

      During college, I studied with C/C++ and have always been interested in embedded systems and low level logic. Thus, I transitioned to Rust and fell in love with its safety and unique memory management.
      I've worked with dockerized microservices, and utilized bash and python scripts to automate their CI/CD workflows. Additionally, these microservices have been deployed with technologies such as Helm and Kubernetes 
      onto Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. <br><br>

      I enjoy exploring new technologies and find new skills refreshing and invigorating. My biggest passion has and always will be learning and sharing my knowledge.
