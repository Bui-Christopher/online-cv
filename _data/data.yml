career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a software engineer with experience in Rust and Python, and I'm working to learn and grow in the development space. I've worked with Rust micro services, utilized gRPC/protocol buffers, and automated workflows with Python scripts. <br><br>
      School was always difficult, and I dropped out of college. Despite struggling, I perservered and proudly graduated with a degree in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton. <br><br>
      During college, I studied with C/C++ and have always been interested in low level logic. I recently transitioned to Rust and fell in love with its unique memory management. My biggest passion has and always will be learning and sharing my knowledge.
